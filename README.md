# ✅ Todo App – Full Stack Project

A full-stack **Todo application** built using:

- **ASP.NET Core Web API** following **Clean Architecture**
- **Vite + React** for the frontend
- **JWT Authentication** with **Refresh Token rotation**
- **Entity Framework Core** for data persistence
- **Swagger** for API documentation

---

## 🧠 What I Built

- 👤 **User Authentication**

  - Registration and login endpoints
  - Short-lived access tokens and long-lived refresh tokens
  - Secure token renewal strategy

- 🧱 **Clean Architecture**

  - Separated layers: Domain, Application, Infrastructure, API
  - Interface-driven design with dependency inversion

- ✅ **Todo Functionality**

  - Create, read, update, delete todos
  - Authenticated endpoints scoped to each user
  - Timestamped and status-tracked todo items

- 📦 **Frontend**

  - Vite-powered React UI
  - JWT stored securely on client
  - Fully integrated with backend API

- 📄 **API Documentation**
  - Swagger UI for testing endpoints

---

## 🚀 Highlights

- 🔐 Full authentication flow (JWT + refresh)
- 🧼 Clean, scalable codebase structure
- 🧪 Tested with Swagger/Postman
